# How to use these hints

These hints are optional. Try each task for **30–45 minutes** before you open the next hint.
Open in this order:
1) 01-concepts → 2) 02-html → 3) 03-js-pipeline → 4) 04-transforms → 5) 05-dom-wiring
Stretch topics: 06 (memoize), 07 (async steps)

**Rule of thumb:** after reading a hint, close it and implement something before opening the next one.
